- Get slide information and content
- Add new slides with different layouts
- Add text boxes to slides
- Update text content in shapes
- Set slide titles
- And more!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv add fastmcp pywin32
   ```

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Navigate to settings
   - Configure the MCP server as explained below

## Configuration

To configure Claude Desktop to use this MCP server, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file, located at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ppts": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "path/to/main.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using a virtual environment or alternative Python executable (like `uv`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ppts": {
      "command": "C:\\Path\\To\\Python\\Scripts\\uv.exe",
      "args": ["run", "C:\\Path\\To\\Project\\main.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can use Claude Desktop to control PowerPoint. Example interactions:

1. Initialize PowerPoint:

   ```
   Could you open PowerPoint for me?
   ```

2. Create a new presentation:

   ```
   Please create a new PowerPoint presentation.
   ```

3. Add a slide:

   ```
   Add a new slide to the presentation.
   ```

4. Add content:

   ```
   Add a text box to slide 1 with the text "Hello World".
   ```

5. Save the presentation:
